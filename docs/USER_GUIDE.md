## üìä Using the Tool

### 1. Preparing Your Data

#### Supported File Formats
- Excel files (.xlsx, .xls)
- Files should have consistent column headers
- Data should be organized in rows and columns

#### File Organization
1. Place your Excel files in the `data/input` directory
2. Ensure files have proper read permissions

### 2. Running the Process

1. **Start the Processing**
   ```bash
   python src/data_processor.py
   ```

2. **Monitor Progress**
   - Check the console for real-time progress
   - Review logs in the `logs` directory

### 3. Output Files

- Processed files are saved in `data/output`
- Files are named with timestamp: `processed_data_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.xlsx`
- Original files remain unchanged in the input directory

## üìã Features

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Removes empty rows and columns
- Strips whitespace from text
- Handles missing values

### 2. Deduplication
- Identifies and removes duplicate records
- Maintains data integrity

### 3. Data Validation
- Ensures data consistency
- Validates data formats

## üìä Example Usage

### Basic Processing
1. Copy Excel files to `data/input`
2. Run the processor
3. Collect results from `data/output`

### Advanced Usage
- Multiple files are processed in sequence
- Results are combined into a single output file
- Detailed logs are generated for tracking

## üìä Running the Data Processing Pipeline

The data processing pipeline can handle various types of Excel files. Here's how to use it:

1. **Prepare Your Data**
   - Place your Excel files in the `data/input` directory
   - Supported file types:
     - Customer data (filename contains "customer")
     - Transaction data (filename contains "transaction")
     - Inventory data (filename contains "inventory")
     - Shipping data (filename contains "shipping")
     - Product reviews (filename contains "review")
     - Error logs (filename contains "error")
     - Combined data (any other Excel file)

2. **Run the Pipeline**
   ```bash
   python src/data_processor.py
   ```

3. **Check the Results**
   - Processed files will be in `data/output` with a `processed_` prefix
   - A processing summary file shows statistics for each processed file
   - Check `data/output/processing.log` for detailed processing steps and any errors

### Understanding the Output

1. **Processed Files**
   - Each processed file maintains the same structure as the input
   - Data is cleaned and standardized
   - Invalid or duplicate records are removed

2. **Processing Summary**
   The summary file contains:
   - Number of records processed per file
   - Column names
   - File-specific statistics:
     - Customer data: Missing phone numbers
     - Transaction data: Total transaction amount
     - Shipping data: Invalid shipping dates
     - Product reviews: Average rating
     - Inventory data: Products below reorder point

3. **Log File**
   The log file (`processing.log`) shows:
   - Start and end of processing for each file
   - Number of records before and after cleaning
   - Any errors or warnings encountered
   - Processing completion status

### Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **File Not Processed**
   - Check if the file is in the correct directory
   - Ensure the file has a `.xlsx` extension
   - Verify the file is not corrupted

2. **Missing Statistics**
   - Ensure your file follows the expected format
   - Check if required columns are present
   - Review the log file for specific errors

3. **Invalid Dates**
   - For shipping data, ensure dates are in a valid format
   - Check if delivery dates are after shipping dates

### Best Practices

1. **File Naming**
   - Use descriptive names that indicate the data type
   - Include the data type in the filename (e.g., "customer", "transaction")
   - Avoid special characters in filenames

2. **Data Preparation**
   - Back up your data before processing
   - Ensure dates are in a consistent format
   - Remove any password protection from Excel files

3. **Monitoring**
   - Check the log file regularly
   - Review processing summaries for unexpected results
   - Keep track of the number of records processed

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **File Not Found**
   - Ensure files are in the correct directory
   - Check file permissions

2. **Processing Errors**
   - Verify Excel file format
   - Check for corrupted files
   - Review log files for details

3. **Memory Issues**
   - Process fewer files at once
   - Close other applications

### Error Messages

| Error | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Permission denied" | Check file permissions |
| "Invalid file format" | Ensure file is proper Excel format |
| "Out of memory" | Process smaller batches |
